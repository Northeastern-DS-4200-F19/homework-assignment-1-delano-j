This repository is your starting point for the assignment. Your instructions are detailed on [the Google Doc for this assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14SmkKMa0xYu-7OEY4V5jdzglEz63ibbV-n5gbyY3KmM/edit?usp=sharing).

NOTE: There was an extra backslash in my path to the first logo - it worked on my Python server which is why I didn't catch it until now, on my GitHub page. It's good to go, and I'm glad it was such a small mistake!
